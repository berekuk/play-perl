  Questhub is a public task tracker with social features and game points.

<h2>Concepts</h2>
<div>
  <h3>Social Todo List</h3>
  <p>
  You can announce your plans, gather the feedback, and find other people to cooperate with on common goals.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Tasks, gamified</h3>
  <p>
    Gamification is great for tuning motivations in a positive way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Questhub gives you points and achievements for each task you complete.
  </p>
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Collaborative prioritization</h3>
  <p>
    By liking other people's quests, you promise them points, or give them points immediately if they already completed the quest.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, people can quickly gather opinions on what the community would prefer you to do.

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>"Quest"? "Player"? "Stencil"? What is this?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
      Quest is any kind of task you're planning to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Player is you, and other people are players too. You get 1 point for each quest you complete, and 1 point for each upvote you receive on your quests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stencil is a blueprint for your quest. You can choose your quest from realm's stencils, or you can invent your own unique quest.
    </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>There are many other bug trackers and to-do lists! How is Questhub different?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
      Questhub is less about planning, and more about fun, motivation, knowledge reuse, and people interaction. We're optimizing Questhub for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>People feeling appreciated;</li>
      <li>Praise being granted and received wherever and whenever necessary;</li>
      <li>Reusing knowledge about the best approach to common tasks;</li>
      <li>Connecting people to let them have more fun together.</li>
    </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>I want a realm about [X], where do I start?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
      <a href="mailto:me@berekuk.ru">Send me an email</a> and let's talk about it.
      People asking for new realms become Realm Keepers, and there are two things I ask of them:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Evangelize your realm. Blog about it, tell people about it, bring them here. You'd be lonely and sad there otherwise.</li>
      <li>Fill it with stencils, at least 5 to get people started. Check out <a href="/realm/perl/stencils">Perl realm's stencils</a> as a good reference point.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If you want to try your hand at it, I'll be happy to hear from you, and generally you'll get your realm in the next 24 hours. But if you abandon your Keeper job and the realm doesn't lift off on its own in a few weeks, I retain the right to merge it and all its quests back into <a href="/realm/chaos">Chaos</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're an experienced community manager, or want to bring an existing community over to Questhub, I'll be especially happy to hear from you.
    </p>

    <dt>Can I use Questhub for claiming a task I already completed, if I didn't create a quest in advance?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
      <a href="/realm/meta/quest/51e9340b7deb5b521800004f">We think</a> it's ok to retrospectively claim a quest, as long as it wasn't too long ago. How long ago depends on the nature / size of the quest.
    </p>
    <p>
    You should only claim retrospective quests based on stencils if they were appropriate challenges for you. If you're a seasoned perl hacker, then don't hoover up the stencils aimed at learners, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this is intentionally somewhat vague, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_gallery">peanut gallery</a> reserves the right to throw nuts and other things at people <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/take_the_mickey">taking the mickey</a>.

    <dt>I can't use this without feature X.</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
      See our <a href="/about/feedback">Feedback</a> page.
    </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How can I create a sub-quest for my quest?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
      You can't organize quests hierarchically, but you can add a task list to your quest's description.
      Read <a href="/about/syntax">Syntax</a> for more details.
      If you're doing a bigger project, you can also use tags.
    </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>What if I want to do create a habit of doing something every day?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
      Creating a quest every day would be burdensome. Rephrase your quest into "Do X every day for a month" (or a week, or whatever you like).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you mark your quest with <code>checkin</code> tag, you will be able to check-in into it. Each checkin saves the current date and time to your quest for tracking. Just try it, it's easier to see than to explain.
    </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I set a deadline for my quest?</dt>
    <dd>
    Not yet. Upvote <a href="/realm/meta/quest/522dcad7968d34df5300006d">this</a> if you want to see it done.
    </dd>

    <dt>How can I add a link to a CPAN module in comments easily?</dt>
    <dd>
    If your Perl module name contains <code>::</code>, and you're on Perl realm, it'll turn into the link to MetaCPAN automatically. Use <code>cpan:Foo</code> syntax for one-word module names.
    </dd>
